# opdscli

I want to create a cli tool to interact with an opds feed.

It should support storing catalogs in ~/.config/opdscli.yaml

It should work with subcommands

```
opdscli search myquery
```

Should search in the catalog for books that contain the query in the title, autor or description fields

```
opdscli download books
```

Should download a given book from a feed

```
opdscli latest
```

Should show latest additions to the catalog.
